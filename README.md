##  Key Highlights:

### Revenue Growth:
Adidas has shown consistent revenue growth over the years, with a slight decrease in 2020 due to global economic challenges. The revenue in 2024 reached **€23,683 million**. Adidas is projected to experience moderate revenue growth, with an average annual growth rate (CAGR) of **3.81%**. By 2030, total revenue is expected to reach **€25.93 billion**, reflecting steady yet sustainable growth despite the challenges faced in earlier years.

### EBIT & EBIT Margin:
EBIT has been increasing, with a strong growth trajectory from **€1,137 million** in 2015 to **€3,334 million** in 2019. The EBIT margin has improved overall, reflecting better cost management. The growth rate will stabilize in the coming years, driven by improved operational efficiency, product innovations, and strategic market positioning. By 2030, EBIT is expected to reach approximately **€2,517 million**, with a stable EBIT margin reflecting enhanced cost control and higher profitability.  
This fluctuation indicates the volatility in Adidas' operational efficiency over the years, especially due to external factors.

### FCF (Free Cash Flow):
Free cash flow (FCF) has also been steadily rising, reaching **€1,864 million** in 2024. This indicates Adidas' growing financial health and its capacity to generate cash for reinvestment. FCF is projected to grow consistently over the next five years. In 2025, FCF is expected to be **€1,500 million**, slightly declining compared to 2024. However, by 2030, it is projected to reach **€1,757 million**. This continuous cash generation suggests that Adidas will maintain its ability to fund investments, reduce debt, and provide returns to shareholders.

### Valuation:
The terminal value based on **EV/EBITDA** multiples and discounted cash flow (DCF) methods indicates a strong enterprise value of **€34,057 million**. The share price is calculated at **€202.52**, implying a fair upside potential from its current price.

### Perpetuity Growth & Discounting:
The analysis assumes a **Terminal Growth Rate (TGR)** of **3.0%** and a **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)** of **8.03%**. These assumptions are factored into the final share price, aligning with Adidas' long-term stability and growth potential. The implied share price of Adidas AG is estimated at **$202.52**, which is approximately **5.3% below** its current share price of **$213.80**, indicating a potential downside in the stock value.

## Key Highlights:

### 1. Net Sales
In **2017**, Net Sales increased from **€16,915 million** in 2015 to **€23,683 million** in 2024, although it fell sharply to **€18,435 million** in 2020. This decline in 2020 was primarily due to the global economic downturn caused by the **COVID-19 pandemic**.

### 2. Gross Profit
The **Gross Profit** followed a similar trend to **Net Sales**, reaching **€12,026 million** in 2024. This shows that despite the decline in 2020, Adidas was able to recover and continue generating strong profits in subsequent years.

### 3. Balance
The balance sheet shows a rising trend over the 10-year period. **Accounts Payable** consistently outnumbered **Accounts Receivable**, suggesting that Adidas has strong control over its liabilities and cash flow management, possibly leveraging favorable payment terms with suppliers.

### 4. Return on Equity (RoE)
**Return on Equity (RoE)** increased to **29%** in 2019, but then dropped sharply to **7%** in 2020. In **2021**, it rebounded to **28%,** before dipping to **-2%** in **2023**. However, it recovered to **14%** in **2024**. This indicates significant fluctuations, which may be attributed to the company's profitability and financial leverage over time, as well as external economic factors.

### 5. Effective Tax Rate
The **Effective Tax Rate** reached an all-time high of **189%** in **2023**, which seems unusual and likely reflects specific one-time adjustments or tax-related items in that year. The average tax rate over the years remained steady at around **27.3%**, which is more in line with typical expectations for a multinational corporation.

### 6. Gross Margin
The **Gross Margin** remained steady at around **50%** throughout the 10 years. This indicates that Adidas has been effective in managing its production costs and maintaining a relatively stable margin despite external market challenges.

### 7. Operating Margin
The **Operating Margin** was lowest in **2023**, at just **1%**, and highest in **2018**, at **11%**. The significant decline in 2023 suggests operational challenges, possibly due to external factors or increased costs, which negatively impacted profitability.

### 8. Equity Ratio
The **Equity Ratio** was **43%** in **2017**, showing that a significant portion of Adidas' assets was financed by equity rather than debt. However, this ratio has been gradually declining and is projected to reach just **27%** in **2024**. This decline suggests that Adidas has become increasingly reliant on debt financing, which could impact its financial stability.

### 9. Financial Leverage
**Financial Leverage** fluctuated greatly, with a negative value of **-15%** in **2018** and peaking at **121%** in **2022**. Currently, there is a downward trend in financial leverage, suggesting that Adidas may be focusing more on reducing its debt and improving its equity position in the coming years.
